# Text Classifier Model

### Description
This project seeks to create a Spanish text classification model that labels phrases as violent or non-violent within an entire chat. The intention is to measure the level of violence in a relationship through the analysis of text messages.

### Objective
Develop a model that, from text messages previously labeled as violent or non-violent, can automatically classify new messages and help identify patterns of violence in communication.

### Contents
1. **Data**
- Spanish text messages previously labeled as violent or non-violent.

2. **Modeling**
- Text classification algorithms.
- Natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
- Model evaluation metrics.

3. **Implementation**
- Python code for data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

### Usage
1. **Data Preparation**
- Cleaning and preprocessing text messages.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing.

2. **Model Training**
- Selecting the classification algorithm.
- Training the model with labeled data.

3. **Model Evaluation**
- Using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.

4. **Classifying New Messages**
- Applying the trained model to classify new text messages.
